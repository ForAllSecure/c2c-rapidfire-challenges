# C2C Rapid Fire Challenges

These files contain the source code + binaries for the challenges used in the
final and semi-final round of C2C (as discussed on our 
[blog](https://blog.forallsecure.com/2016/05/24/live-streaming-security-games/))

### How to use
These files can be run standalone, the goal is to execute the `execute_me`
function. When run as is, this normally will print out a short message like
`Awesome`. Our infrastructure (not included here) will detect when this
function is called and register a score to our server.

### Notes
These may or may not run on your system. These mostly have bugs (that's kind of
the point). Don't run these on a production system, use at your own risk.
